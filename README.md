# opentack-RDO-two-nodes-
OpenStack is a collection of interoperable components that can be deployed to provide computing, networking and storage resources. Those infrastructure resources can then be accessed by end users through programmable APIs.


OpenStack is an open source cloud software which provides infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). It can be installed on single and multiple nodes.

In this project we will deploy openStack on two nodes ( compute and ( controller + network) ) on CentOS 8.x using RDO repository and packstack utility. For Single Node OpenStack Installation refer the below :  https://www.rdoproject.org/install/packstack/
